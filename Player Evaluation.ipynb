    "**Problem Statement**: Many player metrics emphasize quantity or quality or value offense over defense. We want a more complete measure of a player's offensive and defensive ability at the same time, one that captures both quality and quantity. This is not to say that the final number is a single statistitc that can tell us everything about a player\n",

    "1. Taking more shots does not necessarily help your team. Taking and making more shots does\n",
    "2. Quality is not independent of quantity\n",

    "4. A turnover is at least as bad as a missed field goal\n",
